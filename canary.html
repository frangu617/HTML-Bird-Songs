                small songbirds that are native to the Canary Islands, an archipelago off the coast of Africa. They are
                about 12-14 centimeters long and weigh about 18 grams. Canaries have a yellow or green plumage, with
                some breeds having white or black markings. They are known for their beautiful singing, which is
                produced by the syrinx, a vocal organ located at the base of the trachea.
                <br><br>
                Canaries have been domesticated for centuries and are now one of the most popular cage birds in the
                world. They are relatively easy to care for and can live for up to 15 years. Canaries are also used in
                scientific research, as they have a well-understood vocal anatomy and are relatively resistant to
                disease.
